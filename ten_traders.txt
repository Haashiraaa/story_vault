The Ten Traders.

There were once ten traders in a busy marketplace.
Each trader sold the same kind of fish.
Each fish looked the same, was packaged the same, and was sold at the same price: $100.

One day, the tenth trader decided to try something different.
He attached a paper note to one of his fish and went to the market.

Later that morning, a buyer came to the market.
The buyer had a strategy: he wanted to push prices down.
At each stall, he would ask for the price, then frown in disappointment, hoping the next trader would sell cheaper.

At the first stall:
“How much is your fish?”
“$100,” said the trader.
The buyer frowned: “Oh…” and walked away.

The second trader, overhearing this, quickly said, “$90.”
“Oh…”

The third: “$80.”
“Oh…”

The fourth: “$70.”
“Oh…”

And so it went until the ninth trader offered $20.
“Oh…”

Finally, the buyer came to the tenth trader.
“How much is your fish?” he asked.

The tenth trader simply said:
“Pick whichever you want.”

The buyer noticed one fish had a paper note stuck to it.
Curious, he asked:
“What’s written on this?”

The trader shrugged.
“I cannot read. My brother gave me that fish and stuck a note on it. Perhaps you can read it for me?”

The buyer took the fish, looked at the note, and quietly read the words in his own mind:

“Do not sell this fish. It is rare. Value: $10,000.”

His eyes widened. He did not read the words aloud, not wanting the trader to know.

He asked, pretending to be calm:
“How much for this fish?”

The trader replied:
“All my fish are $100 each. But I do not sell them one by one.
I sell all ten together for $1,000.”

The buyer thought quickly:
If I buy all ten for $1,000, I can resell this one rare fish for $10,000. I’ll be rich!

Overjoyed, he handed over the money and carried off all the fish.

The other traders were shocked.
They whispered:
“This same man refused to pay $100 for one fish, yet now he spends $1,000 without question!”

Meanwhile, the tenth trader smiled to himself.
He went home early, caught more fish, and prepared another note for tomorrow.
The trick was simple: while others chased lower prices, he made the buyer chase a dream.
